/**
 * Test Scenario: Participant leaving a collaborative coding room
 * ==============================================================
 *
 * This test script outlines steps to verify the real-time update behavior
 * when a non-host participant leaves a room.
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 * - Running Next.js application
 * - Two separate browsers (or one normal window and one incognito)
 * - Browser developer console open to monitor logs
 *
 * Test Case 1: Non-host participant leaves the room
 * -------------------------------------------------
 * 1. SETUP:
 *    a. In Browser 1: Log in as User A (host)
 *    b. Create a new room
 *    c. In Browser 2: Log in as User B (non-host participant)
 *    d. Join the room using the room ID from Browser 1
 *    e. Verify both users appear in the participants list on both browsers
 *    f. Open developer console (F12) in both browsers and filter console for "[ROOM-UPDATE]"
 *
 * 2. TEST ACTION:
 *    a. In Browser 2 (User B): Click "Leave Room" button
 *    b. Watch the console log in Browser 1 for "[ROOM-UPDATE] ðŸš¨ PARTICIPANT CHANGE DETECTED ðŸš¨"
 *
 * 3. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
 *    a. Browser 2 redirects to dashboard after a short delay (1 second)
 *    b. Browser 1 logs "[ROOM-UPDATE] ðŸš¨ PARTICIPANT CHANGE DETECTED ðŸš¨" in the console
 *    c. Browser 1 (host) immediately updates to show only the host in the participants list
 *    d. The room remains open and functional for the host
 *
 * 4. VERIFICATION:
 *    - Check Browser 1's participants list - it should only show User A
 *    - Look for "[ROOM-UPDATE] ðŸš¨ PARTICIPANT CHANGE DETECTED ðŸš¨" message in Browser 1's console
 *    - Verify the "[ROOM-UPDATE] Participants updated" log in Browser 1's console shows the correct change
 *    - The room should still be operational (can edit code, etc.)
 *
 * Test Case 2: Host leaves the room
 * ---------------------------------
 * 1. SETUP:
 *    a. In Browser 1: Log in as User A (host)
 *    b. Create a new room
 *    c. In Browser 2: Log in as User B (non-host participant)
 *    d. Join the room using the room ID from Browser 1
 *    e. Verify both users appear in the participants list on both browsers
 *
 * 2. TEST ACTION:
 *    a. In Browser 1 (host): Click "Leave Room" button
 *
 * 3. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
 *    a. Browser 1 redirects to dashboard after a short delay
 *    b. Browser 2 shows alert "The host has left the room. The room is now closed."
 *    c. Browser 2 redirects to dashboard
 *    d. The room is closed (no longer accessible)
 *
 * 4. VERIFICATION:
 *    - Attempt to access the room URL directly in both browsers - should redirect to dashboard
 *
 * Troubleshooting:
 * ----------------
 * If the real-time update still doesn't work correctly:
 *
 * 1. Check Browser 1's console for:
 *    - "[ROOM-UPDATE] Room update received" messages
 *    - "[ROOM-UPDATE] ðŸš¨ PARTICIPANT CHANGE DETECTED ðŸš¨" message
 *    - "[SUBSCRIPTION] Room update event received" message
 *
 * 2. Check Browser 2's console for:
 *    - "[LEAVE] Executing standard leave procedure for non-host" message
 *    - "[LEAVE] POST to /api/leave-room/{roomId}" message
 *    - "[LEAVE] Waiting 1000ms to allow real-time updates to propagate..." message
 *
 * 3. Check for errors in the server logs:
 *    - 404 errors for leave-room API endpoints indicate path issues (/api/leave-room/[roomId] folder required)
 *    - 404 errors for debug-host-detection indicate API route issues
 *
 * 4. Check network requests in the Network tab:
 *    - Verify the POST request to /api/leave-room/{roomId} is made
 *    - Check for a 200 status code and inspect the response
 *
 * Implementation Notes:
 * ---------------------
 * The key fixes implemented to ensure proper behavior:
 *
 * 1. Fixed API Routes:
 *    - Created proper dynamic route handlers using Next.js App Router conventions
 *    - Added the leave-room/[roomId] folder structure for dynamic routes
 *    - Enhanced error handling and logging in API endpoints
 *
 * 2. Updated RoomContextProivider:
 *    - Improved participant change detection with clear logging
 *    - Added emoji markers (ðŸš¨, ðŸ‘‹) to make important logs more visible
 *    - Enhanced logging categories with prefixes like [ROOM-UPDATE], [LEAVE], [SUBSCRIPTION]
 *    - Fixed the call to leave-room API to use fetch instead of axios
 *
 * 3. Added detailed logging:
 *    - Each component now has consistent prefix-based logging
 *    - All API endpoints have thorough logging for request/response cycles
 *    - Real-time events are clearly logged with timestamps
 *
 * 4. Fixed race conditions:
 *    - Maintained the 1000ms delay before navigation to ensure proper update propagation
 *    - Improved error handling to maintain state consistency
